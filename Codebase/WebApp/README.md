### WebApp
The WebApp is based on server-client model. The [Server](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/COSE/tree/master/Codebase/WebApp/COSEServer) is implemented with Node.js and [Client](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/COSE/tree/master/Codebase/WebApp/COSEClient) is written in HTML, CSS and JS. Once, the server is started, the client can be run by accessing the index.html page.
